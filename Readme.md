# React Job Application

## About the Application
This is a simple React application that fetches job data from a JSON file and displays it to the user. The user can filter the jobs by tags and undo the filtering by clicking the cancel icon next to each clicked tag. Additionally, there is a clear button that removes all filters and displays all jobs.

To achieve this functionality, the following tools were used:

Tags: `javascript`, `react`, `redux`

## Features

- Add new todos: Users can enter a task description and add it to their list of todos.
- Mark as completed: Users can mark a todo as completed by checking the checkbox next to it.
- Delete todos: Users can delete individual todos they no longer need.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A centralized storage system for managing application state.
- HTML: The markup language used to structure the application.
- CSS: The stylesheets used for the application's visual presentation.
